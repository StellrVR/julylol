                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">June 2023</h2>
                    <p>This was the beginning of my journey in the old web community. This was when I was on Neocities and didn't know what I was doing. Often times, I would resort to what other people would put on their websites and think "Yeah, I'll just do that."</p>
                    <p>The layout was made by <a href="https://almostsweet.neocities.org">AlmostSweet</a>.</p>
                    <p>The self-portrait was made by my wonderful girlfriend, <a href="https://wysteriaillustrations.art">Wysteria</a>.</p>
                    <p>(There was a background, but Wayback Machine doesn't show those for some reason.)</p>

                <section class="full">
                    <h2 style="text-align: center">July 2023</h2>
                    <p>Starting from this point, I began to switch layouts very often because I wasn't sure what I wanted to do in terms of how I want to portray myself in the community (not that it matters anyway).</p>
                    <p>In this layout, I wanted a chill and simplistic vibe. So I used a layout from <a href="https://eggramen.neocities.org">Eggramen</a> and worked from there.</p>
                    <p>(This layout also had a background, but it was a gif of some homey, chill cafe I found from Tumblr, I think.)</p>

                <section class="full">
                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">November 2023</h2>
                    <p>This layout was around the time when I wanted to show off some of my projects that I had, and I was really into the retro terminal aesthetic and made a terminal-like splash page (see second image).</p>
                    <p>At this point, I was using my website as a way to show off who I am from a perspective of what I believed people <em>should</em> see me as, and not actively expressing who I really am. Which I no longer do today.</p>
                    <p>This is also the time when I started taking inspiration from layouts instead of using them outright. This layout was inspired by <a href="https://whiona.me">Whiona</a>.</p>
                    <p>I also started blogging using weblog.lol and bearblog, but stopped after a while.</p>
                    <p>This layout also kickstarted my own webring called VRRing, a webring for virtual reality enthusiasts and gamers. You can check out this layout and the webring <a href="https://july.lol/vrring/home.html">here</a>.</p>

                    <h2 style="text-align: center;">June 2024</h2>
                    <p>For a while, I neglected my website since I had a lot of other things going on in my life. I was playing a lot of VRChat and doing roleplay stuff, I started going to college again, and was spending a lot of time with my girlfriend.</p>
                    <p>I used <a href="https://jdan.github.io/98.css/">98.css</a> as a baseline, then just used that to make whatever I wanted.</p>
                    <p>The bigger window on the right showed some stuff about me, and the nav bar on the left didn't even work.</p>
                    <p>Speaking of neglect, this is what my website looked like for a very long time, even when I switched over here to Nekoweb.</p>
